## Three Parts. One Ecosystem.
AgenticGoKit is intentionally split into **three parts** so developers can build fast and end users get reliable systems:

1. **AgenticGoKit** — Core framework for multi-agent systems in Go.
2. **AGK** — Developer tooling for scaffolding, tracing, and workflow orchestration.
3. **agk-templates** — Official template registry used by AGK.

---

## The Three Projects

| Part | Repository | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **1. Core Framework** | [AgenticGoKit/AgenticGoKit](https://github.com/AgenticGoKit/AgenticGoKit) | Build multi-agent systems with memory, RAG, tools, and orchestration. |
| **2. Developer Tooling** | [AgenticGoKit/agk](https://github.com/AgenticGoKit/agk) | CLI for scaffolding, tracing, and managing agent workflows. |
| **3. Template Registry** | [agk-templates](https://github.com/agk-templates) | Official templates powering AGK scaffolds and integrations. |

---

## Optimized for Developers
- **Go performance & type safety** — fast, reliable, and production-ready.
- **Scaffold in minutes** — start from vetted templates with AGK.
- **Trace & debug** — built-in workflow tracing to ship confidently.
- **Composable architecture** — mix agents, memory, and tools with clear APIs.

## Built for End Users
- **Reliable production systems** — predictable behavior under load.
- **Faster time-to-value** — shipping-ready workflows from day one.
- **Secure and configurable** — environment-first, config-driven deployment.
- **Observability-ready** — monitoring and tracing to keep systems healthy.

---

## Typical Flow
**Design** → **Scaffold** → **Build** → **Ship**

- **Design** with the core framework.
- **Scaffold** with AGK using official templates from agk-templates.
- **Build & ship** with your preferred deployment stack.
